    "    Copy the file `FEexercise7_2022Data.xls` from the course homepage (this was the file from Exercise 5). Based on the S&P100 option prices, try to make portfolios such as butterfly, bull spread, bear spread, etc. You can then follow how the value of the portfolio changes as a function of time to maturity.\n",
    "\n",
    "    You can simply draw three figures, one for the price of the underlying, one for the separate prices of the options and one for the value of the portfolio. Remember that you can take either a long or a short position regarding the portfolio (if you assume that the price of the underlying will move a little, you can take a long position in a butterfly; if you assume that the price of the underlying will move a lot, you can short a butterfly.) Try different strike prices when taking positions and look how it affects the value of the corresponding portfolio.\n",
